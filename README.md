# Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection from Single-Lead ECG: A Comprehensive Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms
In this project, we implemented a number of machine learning and deep learning methods for sleep apnea detection
Conventional machine learning methods have four main steps for sleep apnea detection: pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification.
After extracting R-peaks from ECG signal, we extracted time, frequency, and non-linear features of ECG signal. Principal component analysis then applied for dimension reduction.
Linear discriminate analysis (LDA), Quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA), Support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Multi-layer perceptrun (MLP),Decision tree (DT), Extra tree (ET), Random forest (RF), Adaboost, Gradient boosting (GB), Logistic regression (LR), and Majority voting (MV) methods are well-known conventional machine learning methods that were implimented and compared for sleep apnea detection from single-lead ECG.
